# SwiftLearning
All of these are sample code files created from what I understood while learning swift

Instead of adding 1000 certificates on LinkedIn, I thought it will be good to takes notes myself, add my practical projects as well as the exercise files over here, so that maybe one day someone will benefit from this and also I can showcase my real projects, instead of the piece of paper.
